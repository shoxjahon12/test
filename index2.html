  <p>A forest is an ecosystem characterized by a dense community of 
    trees.[1] Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout 
    the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, 
    land use, legal standing, and ecological function.[2][3][4]
     The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
     defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with 
     trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 
     percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does 
     not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban
      use."[5] Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment
       2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares 
       (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million 
       square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land 
       area in 2020.[6]</p>
